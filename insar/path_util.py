    Append a suffix onto the end of a path, without removing existing suffixes.

    as the concept of a suffix needing to begin with a '.', as such this also
    supports our use-case of having '_' based suffixes for many files.

    .slc or .mli file, this is a helper function to do that a little cleaner.
