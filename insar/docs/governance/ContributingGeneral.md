 * Detailed steps to reproduce the bug (including stack traces if possible).

If in doubt, refer to existing bug report issues for hints on what might be useful.

## Fix Bugs ##

Not all bugs reports get the priority we would like, as such it's possible there are open bug reports sitting there waiting to be fixed!

Take a look at the [Github issues here](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/gamma_insar/issues) to get started, bug reports should have the `bug` label.

Please refer to the [code contribution guide](ContributingCode.md) for details on making code contrubutions for your bug fixes.

## Contribute Features ##

If `gamma_insar` lacks a feature you're willing to implement, code contributions are welcome!  Before getting started, we recommend opening a github issue with the `enhancement` label to get some feedback and advice to save you time duplicating code or putting in effort for no reason!

Additionally we may already have existing [Github issues](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/gamma_insar/issues) with the `enhancement` label just waiting for someone's time and attention!

Please refer to the [code contribution guide](ContributingCode.md) for details on getting stared on this process.
