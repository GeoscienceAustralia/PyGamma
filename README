GAMMA PROCESSING WORKFLOW DIRECTORY SETUP

'gamma_insar' directory contains all the scripts used in the auto processing workflow

'gamma_insar/general_scripts' directory contains scripts that are run manually by the user (ie. outside the auto processing workflow)
   - eg. check_slave_coregistration.bash

'gamma_insar/ARCHIVE' directory contains a copy of all the scripts available prior to major upgrade of GAMMA scripts in August 2018

'gamma_insar/S1_FRAME_CREATION' directory contains scripts for archive metadata scraping. These results are inputs for the python notebooks to create stacks of scenes for
   pre-defined 'frames'.


USAGE

When 'loadgamma' is run, all scripts in 'gamma_insar' and 'general_scripts' directories will be available on the command line

'gamma.proc', 'process_gamma' and 'gamma_functions' are the scripts used to run auto processing
    - 'gamma.proc' is the configuration file
    - 'process_gamma' calls the other scripts
    - 'gamma_functions' sets the variables used by the scripts


PYTHON NOTEBOOKS

To use the metadata scraping and scene list creation notebooks, these need to be run in the VDI. Uses Python3.



STEPS

1. Create top-level project directory structure in NCI (ie. INSAR_ANALYSIS/<project>/<sensor>/GAMMA)

2. 'loadgamma'

3. Copy proc file template, update details and put in directory created in step 1

4. A DEM file which covers the scene extent is now automatically created for scenes covering Australia. A manual DEM needs to be created for other areas:
      - if a suitable DEM doesn't exist on MDSS:
          a. use ArcGIS to create an ASCII file of the DEM (GA InSAR Processing Guide details steps for this)
          b. copy ASCII file to irectory created in step 1
   	  c. create GAMMA DEM using 'general_scripts/make_GAMMA_DEM.bash'
	  d. update proc file with DEM details

5. Sensor lists:
    SENTINEL-1
       - S1_T<track>_F<frame>_<polar>_scene_stack.txt
           a. use S1_frame_scene_stack_creation_final.ipynb to generate list
       
    SENSORS WHERE FRAMES ARE USED (not Sentinel-1)
       - frame.list
          a. file format is: <frame_number>. For example:
               7160
	       7170	
          b. move list to directory created in step 1

6. Start processing
     - run 'process_gamma <track>.proc' on command line



SENTINEL-1

If subsettting a pre-defined frame by bursts, the bursts need to be identified. Determine bursts from preview scene full SLC PDFs and update proc file with values.
