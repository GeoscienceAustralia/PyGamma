GAMMA PROCESSING WORKFLOW DIRECTORY SETUP

'gamma_insar' directory contains all the scripts used in the auto processing workflow

'gamma_insar/general_scripts' directory contains scripts that are run manually by the user (ie. outside the auto processing workflow)
   - eg. check_slave_coregistration.bash

'gamma_insar/ARCHIVE' directory contains a copy of all the scripts available prior to major upgrade of GAMMA scripts in August 2018



USAGE

When 'loadgamma' is run, all scripts in 'gamma_insar' and 'general_scripts' directories will be available on the command line

'gamma.proc', 'process_gamma' and 'gamma_functions' are the scripts used to run auto processing
    - 'gamma.proc' is the configuration file
    - 'process_gamma' calls the other scripts
    - 'gamma_functions' sets the variables used by the scripts



STEPS

1. Create top-level project directory structure in NCI (ie. INSAR_ANALYSIS/<project>/<sensor>/GAMMA)

2. 'loadgamma'

3. Copy proc file template, update details and put in directory created in step 1

4. A DEM file which covers the scene extent is now automatically created for scenes covering Australia. A manual DEM needs to be created for other areas:
      - if a suitable DEM doesn't exist on MDSS:
          a. use ArcGIS to create an ASCII file of the DEM (GA InSAR Processing Guide details steps for this)
          b. copy ASCII file to irectory created in step 1
   	  c. create GAMMA DEM using 'general_scripts/make_GAMMA_DEM.bash'
	  d. update proc file with DEM details

5. Sensor lists:
    SENTINEL-1
       - s1_download.list
           a. use ArcGIS to generate a list of files to download
           b. file format is: <date> <grid_dir> <zip_file> <frame_number>
               - can have up to 3 frames per date. Don't need the same number of frames for all dates. For example:
	          20180423  <grid_dir> <zip_file> 1
	          20180423  <grid_dir> <zip_file> 2
	          20180423  <grid_dir> <zip_file> 3
	   	  20180523  <grid_dir> <zip_file> 1
		  20180523  <grid_dir> <zip_file> 2
          c. move list to directory created in step 1
       
    SENSORS WHERE FRAMES ARE USED (not Sentinel-1)
       - frame.list
          a. file format is: <frame_number>. For example:
               7160
	       7170	
          b. move list to directory created in step 1

6. Start processing
     - run 'process_gamma <track>.proc' on command line



SENTINEL-1

If subsettting by bursts, the bursts will need to be identified and put into 'subset_burst.list'
    - file format is: <date> <swath_num> <start_burst> <end_burst>. For example:
	   20180423 1 5 9
	   20180423 2 6 10
	   20180423 3 5 9
	   20180523 1 6 10
	   20180523 2 5 9
	   20180523 3 5 9
    a. if list is created before processing starts, move list to directory created in step 1
    b. if list created later, move into 'lists' directory
